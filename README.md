# üè† Spark Documentation

## **Welcome to Spark!**

**Spark** is on a mission to empower the DAI ecosystem. As part of the MakerDAO community, Spark builds and manages DeFi infrastructure.

The 3 main DeFi infrastructure projects:

* **SparkLend**: The DAI centric money market protocol. Combining the best liquidity directly from Maker and vertically integrating with the best DeFi protocols.
* **sDAI** is a yield bearing stablecoin, representing DAI in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module, which distributes revenue from the Maker protocol to DAI holders.
* **SparkConduits** allow for direct liquidity from Maker to protocols as part of the overall Maker Allocation System.

**SparkDAO** is a Maker Allocator subDAO that owns and manages Spark through decentralised governance. Its launch, alongside the other subDAOs, is scheduled for May 2024.

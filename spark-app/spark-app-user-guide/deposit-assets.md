# Deposit Assets

In order to borrow other assets than Dai, you must first deposit assets as collateral such as ETH or WBTC. Deposited assets can be borrowed by other users and therefore earns interest. You can also simply deposit assets without borrowing, to earn interest.

1.  To deposit assets into Spark, navigate to the Dashboard page.\

2.  Scroll down to the the **Deposit** section which shows the following information:

    * **Assets:** The different assets that can be deposited into Spark
    * **In Wallet:** Amount of the specific asset in your wallet, and its value in USD.
    * **Deposit**: Amount of the asset you have deposited into Spark.
    * **APY:** The current annual percentage yield. Deposited assets can be borrowed by other users, and therefore earns yield.

3. You deposit assets by clicking on the Deposit button for the corresponding asset, which will open the Deposit window.\

4. The Deposit window will display:
   * Amount: Here you specify the amount of the specific asset you wish to deposit.
   * Transaction overview: Shows the supply APY for the asset and whether the asset is enabled as collateral.
   *   Actions: An overview of the necessary transactions you must do to create the deposit.\

6. You receive spTokens in return which reflect your deposit into Spark. You need these tokens to withdraw your assets from the protocol, so keep them in your wallet.\

7. If you wish to deposit more assets, for example to increase the Health Factor of your borrow position, you simply repeat this process.\

8.  You can use the “Collateral” toggle to enable or disable an asset as collateral for your borrow position. Disabling an already supplied asset as collateral will impact the Health Factor of your position, as the asset will no longer count towards the collateral value and loan to value.\

# FAQ

## Spark

### What is Spark?

**Spark** is on a mission to empower the USDS ecosystem. As part of the Sky Ecosystem, Spark builds and manages DeFi infrastructure.

Spark consists of three main product categories:

* **SparkLend**: The USDS centric money market protocol. Combining the best liquidity directly from Sky and vertically integrating with the best DeFi protocols.
* **Savings**: Earn savings on your stablecoin holdings
* **SparkConduits:** Direct liquidity provision into DeFi markets.

### Scams and fake accounts

Be careful, it is common for scammers to create fake social media accounts and websites that mimic Spark products or services to steal user funds. Therefore always ensure you are only using the official Spark products on the official domain.

The legitimate Spark domain is:

* [https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi)

Any subdomain based on the above domains will also be legitimate, such as docs.spark.fi

Beware of the following:

* Domains that look similar but are not **exactly** the same, it can be a single character or different top-level domain (.com, .net, .scam)
* Clickable domains on social media, these can look legitimate on the platform, such as Twitter, but once clicked the user is redirected to a different domain.
* People who contact you via social media, including Twitter, Telegram and LinkedIn claiming to be a contributor of Spark. Always verify their identity by asking on the public discord or with someone that you trust.
* Websites without https (http does not provide encryption nor verification)
* Any Spark mobile application
* Any website asking you for your seed passphrase (you should not share this with anyone)&#x20;
* Spark does not advertise on social media (e.g. tweets with "Ad" on the top right), on websites or search engines.

## SparkLend

### What is SparkLend?

SparkLend is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized and perpetual fashion. Please join the [Spark Discord](https://discord.gg/sparkdao), the community looks forward to helping you understand and use SparkLend.

The protocol is completely open source, which allows anyone to interact with a user interface client, API or directly with the smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Being open source means that you are able to build any third-party service or application to interact with the protocol and enrich your product.

### How do I interact with SparkLend?

[getting-started.md](user-guides/getting-started.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### What is the cost of interacting with SparkLend?

Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for Ethereum Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity.

### Where are my deposited funds stored?

Your funds are deposited in a non-custodial smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, formally verified and audited by third party auditors. No centralized entity can access deposited funds.

### Are there any risks?

No platform can be considered entirely risk-free. The risks related to the SparkLend platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). Every possible step has been taken to minimize the risk as much as possible, the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited. Additionally, you can find additional security-related information in the [security and audits](https://devs.spark.fi/security-and-audits) sections.

### Address Screening

**Why is my wallet blocked?** We receive blockchain intelligence provided by [TRM Labs](https://www.trmlabs.com/). TRM combines on-chain data and real-world investigations to identify financial crime and other prohibited activities. This data blocks wallets from app.spark.fi that are associated with certain legally prohibited conduct.If you believe your address has been incorrectly flagged, please contact [contact@marsfoundation.xyz](mailto:contact@marsfoundation.xyz).

**What information is shared with TRM Labs?** Your address is shared with TRM, but no metadata is tracked or shared. The request from the UI is routed to the SparkLend hosted API, which is used as a proxy endpoint, and the address is passed directly through to the TRM service. Users' IP addresses are not shared with TRM.

## Savings

### What is sDAI? <a href="#what-is-sdai" id="what-is-sdai"></a>

Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by Sky. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.

sDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.

To acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](user-guides/earning-savings/).

For technical documentation on the sDAI implementation please refer to the [Developer docs](https://devs.spark.fi/sdai/technical-docs).

## SparkConduits

### What are SparkConduits?

SparkConduits are technical components that enables Sky to provide stablecoin liquidity directly to an external protocol such as Aave or Morpho.

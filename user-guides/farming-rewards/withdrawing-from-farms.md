# Withdrawing From Farms

## Tutorial

1. To withdraw your deposit from a farm, you must first navigate to the specific Farm you have deposited into. In this example we use the SKY Farm.

2. On the specific Farm page, you can see an overview of how many tokens you have earned, and your deposit.

5. If you are withdrawing other assets than USDS, it will show the conversion route. The conversion uses Sky non-custodial contracts, which converts at no slippage or fees beyond gas.

6. You can also click the toggle to withdraw accrued token rewards in the same transaction.
7. Finalize your withdrawal by completing the transactions outlined in the **Actions panel**.
8. Once you have submitted the transactions you will see the following confirmation window.

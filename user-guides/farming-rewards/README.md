### Can I deposit Savings USDS or Savings DAI?

You can only deposit USDS, however you are able to convert savings tokens to USDS and deposit into the farm in a single transaction. You are therefore not able to both earn the Sky Savings Rate and earn Sky Token Rewards at the same time using the same funds.

### What are the risks?

USDS is simply deposited into a non-custodial smart contract, and is not being used for beyond calculating the userâ€™s share of rewards. Deposited funds are not being used in any liquidity pool, or staking mechanism, and can therefore always be instantly withdrawn with no liquidity constraints and no fees beyond gas cost. No other actor than the user itself have access to deposited funds. You are therefore not taking on any market or staking related risks.

# E-Mode

### High Efficiency Mode (E-mode)

The E-mode feature maximizes capital efficiency when collateral and borrowed assets have correlated prices. For example, sDAI, USDC, USDT are all stablecoins pegged to USD. These stablecoins are all within the same E-mode category. Accordingly, a user supplying sDAI in E-mode will have higher collateralization power when borrowing assets like USDC or USDT.

Only assets of the same category (for example stablecoins) can be borrowed in E-mode.

E-mode does not restrict the usage of other assets as collateral. Assets outside of the E-mode category can still be supplied as collateral with normal LTV and liquidation parameters.

### How do I enter E-mode?

To enter E-mode from the go to **My portfolio** and find the **Borrow** section. Here you will find an **E-Mode Toggle**, which you can click.\

### How do I exit E-mode?

### How does E-mode affect my borrowing power?

When E-mode is enabled, you will have higher borrowing power over assets of the same E-mode category.
